# musicStore
This repository is the template developed by Angel Mercado to create a e-commerce, basically it uses a spring mvc, spring core, spring flow and hibernate to mapping the tables, also the cart module integrates angular js to comsume some webservice REST exposed through a RestController in the same aplication. I considered this online store as monolitic arquitecture. I'm goig to develop more 
modules and sofisticate them. For now it uses paypal integration, I hope integrate it with stripe as soon as i can.
